# Floating Booking Modal Implementation

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Quick Booking Widget from Sidebar**
- The Quick Booking Widget is no longer permanently visible in the teacher profile sidebar
- This creates a cleaner, less cluttered interface
- More focus on the teacher's information and credentials

### 2. **Added Floating Modal Trigger**
- The "ðŸŽ¯ Book Trial Lesson" button in the pricing card now opens a floating modal
- Modal appears as an overlay on top of the current page
- Non-intrusive design that doesn't navigate away from the teacher profile

### 3. **Enhanced Quick Booking Widget for Modal Use**
- Added optional `onClose` and `showCloseButton` props
- When used as a modal, shows a close button (X) in the top-right corner
- Updated title from "Quick Booking" to "Book Your Trial Lesson" for modal context
- Maintains all original functionality (calendar, time slots, booking flow)

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Flow

### Before (Old Flow):
1. User sees Quick Booking Widget always visible in sidebar
2. Sidebar feels cluttered with multiple cards
3. Widget competes for attention with other information

### After (New Flow):
1. User browses teacher profile without distractions
2. When ready to book, clicks "ðŸŽ¯ Book Trial Lesson" button
3. **Floating modal appears** with booking calendar
4. User selects date and time in the modal
5. Completes booking or closes modal to continue browsing
6. Returns to clean teacher profile view
